### A collection of architects, chartered surveyors and designers. We all met studying for our BSc Architecture at Bath in 2009. Bright eyed and bushy tailed we all thought we would be living in our own homes 10+ years after we starting our studies, however, we are all still renting...
### We formed because we were fed up of seeing (and designing) new build properties on the market at rate we would never be able to afford. We are on the hunt for brownfield sites in London that we can design and develop and then live in.

### We care about sustainable design, good quality homes and living in a community and sharing resources.
